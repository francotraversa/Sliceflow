**Sliceflow** is a high-performance backend API engineered to modernize the management of 3D Printing Farms (FDM & SLS). Unlike traditional CRUD apps, Sliceflow acts as an **intelligent agent**, automating prioritization, monitoring stock, and enforcing security policies in real-time.

Built with **Golang**, designed with **Clean Architecture**, and containerized for immediate deployment.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

The project follows a strict **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** to ensure scalability, testability, and separation of concerns.
